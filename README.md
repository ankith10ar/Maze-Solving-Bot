# Maze-Solving-Bot
The project is to use the power of swarm robotics and make multiple bot communicate among themselves to solve a maze. 
The main core of the Bot is Arduino Uno. We used Bluetooth module to make the bots communicate among themselves and send the data to the PC or Mobile to print the maze on a display. 

Duration:<br /> *July â€“ 2016 to December - 2016*

Technologies: 
* Arduino IDE
* Android
* Processing  

Contribution: 
* Implemented algorithm to establish communication between bots. 
* Design of android app to receive Bluetooth info from the bots. 
* Implemented processing code to receive values and design a maze.
